# 15.0.0-arm64

Install Microg on Custom ROM based on Android 15 

This is a simple MicroG installation zip file. Flash this zip file via recovery immediately after flashing the AOSP-based custom ROM such as LineageOS. This will install MicroG and other related packages into the system partition. Please note that flashing this zip will not install MicroG on phones that already have Google Services installed.

Thanks to projects like Lineageos4microg, MindTheGapps, MinMicrog and NikGapps.
